# FurnishFind

FurnishFind is an AI-driven web application that recommends the best second-hand furniture pieces for a given room, helping users furnish sustainably and reduce waste.

## Why FurnishFind?

Global furniture waste is rising: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that around **10 million** pieces of furniture were discarded in 2024, while the European Environmental Agency reported roughly **14.4 million** pieces heading to landfills. That’s more than a million pounds of natural materials wasted. FurnishFind tackles this problem by making it easy to match preloved furniture with rooms that need it.

## How It Works

1. **Upload a Room Photo**  
   Users upload a photo of a room via the web interface.

2. **Room Understanding**  
   A pretrained room CNN (ResNet-18 backbone) converts the image into an embedding that captures the style and layout of the room.

3. **Furniture Matching**  
   The backend compares the room embedding against a vector database of embeddings for second-hand furniture (scraped from eBay). The three closest matches are returned with product links.

4. **Results Page**  
   The web app displays the original room photo alongside the top three furniture recommendations, each with an image and "Buy Now" link.

## Dataset & Model Pipeline

- **Data Collection**
  - Scraped thousands of furnished-room images from Kaggle, IKEA, Getty Images, and similar sources (`ScrappingAlgRoom.ipynb`).
  - Used GPT-4 Vision to filter out poorly furnished or irrelevant images.
  - Segmented individual furniture items using **YOLOv8** (`YOLOSCANCODE.ipynb`), masking the background to remove context.

- **Training**
  - Built a **contrastive learning** setup using triplet loss.
  - Room and furniture embeddings generated by ResNet-18 variants.
  - Achieved **89.7%** accuracy after 20 training epochs.

- **Embedding & Recommendation**
  - Precomputed furniture embeddings stored in `furniture_embeddings.csv`.
  - Room model weights available as `room_model_837%_312am.pth`.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install flask torch torchvision pandas pillow
   ```

2. **Run the Web App**

   ```bash
   python main2.py
   ```

   The app starts on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Navigate there, upload a room photo, and explore the top furniture matches.

## Future Improvements

- Expand furniture inventory beyond eBay.
- Fine-tune embeddings for styles, colors, and size constraints.
- Release a mobile-friendly interface and batch-processing API.
- Integrate sustainability scores and carbon-footprint estimates for each recommendation.

## Acknowledgments
